# Predicting Air Quality Levels using Machine Learning

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict air quality levels based on pollutant concentration levels using a logistic regression model and other machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify the air quality into different levels (e.g., "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy") using real-world data on air pollutants. The project tackles issues such as data preprocessing, class imbalance, and model performance visualization.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, scaled features, and normalized input data.
- **SMOTE:** Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Modeling:** Developed a logistic regression model for air quality classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Visualized model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other metrics.
- **Future Work:** Proposed additional improvements, including advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and additional features such as meteorological data.
