#Predicting Air Quality Levels using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict air quality levels based on pollutant concentration levels using a logistic regression model and other machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify the air quality into different levels (e.g., "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy") using real-world data on air pollutants. The project tackles issues such as data preprocessing, class imbalance, and model performance visualization.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and normalized input data.
SMOTE: Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the dataset.
Modeling: Developed a logistic regression model for air quality classification.
Model Evaluation: Visualized model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other metrics.
Future Work: Proposed additional improvements, including advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and additional features such as meteorological data.
